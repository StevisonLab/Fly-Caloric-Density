##Analysis of weight at day 7

#Set working directory -- You can type out the path but I like to 
#go to Session --> Set working directoring --> Choose working directory...

#Grab the data file from your computer. I sometimes having issues working from Box,so you may want to download
#the file to your computer. When you run the below, a File explorer will appear and you can select the appropriate csv file
#datum is an object -- we can choose any name we want -- it's just what we're going to call our data file from now on.
datum=read.csv(file.choose())

#Visualizing data. Because our x-axis is a numerical variable, R assumes a continuous variable. Is this appropriate?
plot(Weight~Treatment,data=datum)


#as.factor tells R to treat the variable as categorical which gets you a box plot
plot(Weight~as.factor(Treatment),data=datum)

#Running a linear model with treatment as a categorical variable. This SHOULD be a nested design -- we've
#pseudoreplicated by sampling multiple individuals from only one vial per treatment
results=lm(Weight~(as.factor(Treatment)),data=datum)

#This is how we get our p-values -- i.e. see if we have significant differences.
summary(results)

#Relevel allows you to set the reference (i.e. which group we're comparing to, usually the control)
results2=lm(Weight~relevel(as.factor(Treatment),ref="1"),data=datum)
summary(results2)

#Relevel to get last comparison which has not been made
results3=lm(Weight~relevel(as.factor(Treatment),ref="2"),data=datum)
summary(results3)
